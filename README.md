# Flashcards for IT-Högskolan Courses
*Created and maintained by [Andreas Svensson](https://github.com/Andreas-Svensson)*

<br>

This repo contains flashcards for the AI & Machine Learning course at IT-Högskolan. Cards are stored in .txt format structured to be compatible with Anki which is a popular free flashcard program.

The goal of this repo is to share notes in card format between all students of the course so everyone has easy acess to science-based fast and efficienct learning.

To keep up with changes made here, make sure to watch/star this repository. This way you will be notified when new cards or featres are added.

Easy ways for all students to add their cards through GitHub will be added soon. In the meantime, if you want to contribute notes in card format, send me a message on any platform and they will be added.

#### Quick installation guide:
1. Download Anki for desktop from [here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
2. Install Anki in english (important for cards to work)
3. Download the .txt file from this repo to get all cards available
4. Open Anki, go to Import, select the downloaded file and import
5. (Optional) Create an Ankiweb account [here](https://ankiweb.net/about) and connect it to your desktop program. This way your cards and progress will be synced across devices so you can study on any device.

**FAQ**  
Q: How to use Anki on iPhone?  
A: Use Ankiweb in a browser for free  

Q: Why are cards failing to import?  
A: Make sure Anki is installed in english  

For the most part I'm not an expert in Anki, if you have issues with installation and setup or questions about usage check out the documenation [here](https://docs.ankiweb.net/), there is also a lot of good information available on forums online as the Anki community is very passionate, active and helpful.

## What are Flashcards
An efficient approach to aquisition and retention of knowledge using science-based methods like spaced repetition and active recall.  

Using digital flashcards, it's possible to learn hundreds of new bits of information every month in just a few minutes per day. It's easy to fit in study sessions during any downtime in the day, such as when commuting to work/school for example.  

The flashcard program handles what to study and when, all you have to do is finish due cards every day and the information will make it's way into your long term memory very efficiently.  

For the science-based methods to work optimally it's more important to do a litle bit every day than to cram large study sessions a few days a week. More detailed information about the science will be added later.

### Card and Deck Structure

Cards all have a front and a back, usually with a question on the front, and the answer to it on the back. When you study a card, read the front, try to guess (if it's your first time encountering it) or remember (if you have encountered it before) what the answer on the back of the card is.

All cards are parts of a deck, or a subdeck of a larger deck. This way, its possible to structure what kind of cards you want to study at any given time by selecting which deck(s) to pick cards from.

Using a program to manage decks and review intervals, as well as the rate at which to learn, you are presented a few new cards to study each day from whatever deck you are studying.

The flashcard program automatically handles when cards appear, all you have to focus on is to study the cards that appear, and the program will attempt to maximise the value you get out of your study sessions.

### How to Study

1. Start a review session. The program handles which cards to study and presents them to you one at a time. Answer the question and rate the card based on how well you knew the answer.  

2. The program's algorithm decides how long it should likely take you to forget the answer based on your rating and review history, and schedules the card for review slightly before that time.  

3. When the card automatically re-appears in "due" cards, repeat steps 1-2. Over time the the information will be better remembered and the card will appear for review less and less often, which leaves space for more new cards to enter the loop.
